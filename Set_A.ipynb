Agricultural land referred to in paragraph one of this Article shall be deemed to be land that, as is evident from the design documentation, is used as arable fields, home gardens, grassland, permanent cropland or other agricultural land. In addition to the components laid down by the regulation governing design documentation, the design documentation for facilities for which the payment of land use conversion compensation is obligatory must also include data on the type and surface area of the actual use of land on which the floor area of the facility is located, whereby the actual use shall be extracted from the records of actual land use in accordance with the Act regulating agriculture.',\n",

Persons responsible for damage to land or crops shall be liable for compensation for damage to the owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land or crops in accordance with regulations. Article 6 The provisions of this Act with regard to the use and cultivation of agricultural land shall also apply to land that is designated as construction land or non-agricultural land in a spatial planning document until a building permit or another relevant act is issued for such land in accordance with regulations. Article 7 An owner, lessee or other user of agricultural land referred to in paragraph three of Article 2 of this Act must: -         cultivate agricultural land with due diligence; -         prevent the natural succession of vegetation on agricultural land, except on agricultural land that, in accordance with the regulation governing the records of actual land use, meets the conditions for land use classified as \"trees and shrubs\";'"

        "Answer: Consider using a unified language model like OpenAI's GPT-3 for both semantic search and answer generation. By leveraging the language model directly, we can eliminate the need for a separate vector database and potentially simplify the process. We can Use GPT-3/Gemini pro or Llma for context understanding, question answering, and generating responses based on the user query. Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques directly on models for optimal results. This approach may reduce complexity and improve the efficiency of the system. However, carefully evaluate the trade-offs, including API costs and response times, based on your specific use case and requirements."
